# ChatAppGUI

A simple GUI-based chat application in Java that allows a client and a server to communicate. The chat stops when either party sends "bye."

## Features
- Both client and server ask for the user's name at the start.
- If a user types "hii", the response is "Hii + Name".
- If a user types "bye", the response is "Bye + Name", and the chat application closes.
- GUI-based interface using Swing.
- Real-time communication between server and client.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run

### 1. Compile the Java Files
```sh
javac ChatServer.java ChatClient.java
```

### 2. Start the Server
```sh
java ChatServer
```

### 3. Start the Client
```sh
java ChatClient
```

## How to Use
- The server and client will both ask for a name when started.
- Users can send messages through the GUI.
- If either user types "hii", the other user receives "Hii [Name]".
- If either user types "bye", the chat ends.
