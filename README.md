# ChatAppGUI 📢

A simple and interactive GUI-based chat application in Java using Swing, allowing real-time communication between a client and a server. The chat session ends when either user types "bye".

## 🚀 Features

✔️ **Username Input**: Both client and server enter their names at the start.  
✔️ **Smart Replies**:
- If a user types `hii`, the other receives `Hii [Name]`.
- If a user types `bye`, the chat responds `Bye [Name]` and closes automatically.
✔️ **Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing**.  
✔️ **Real-time communication between client and server**.  
✔️ **Simple & Lightweight** - No external dependencies needed.
